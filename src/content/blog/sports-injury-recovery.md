Recovering from a sports injury takes time, but with the right approach, you can return stronger than before.

## The Phases of Recovery

### Phase 1: Acute (0–72 hours)

Rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) help manage swelling. Early physiotherapy can guide safe movement and prevent further damage.

### Phase 2: Sub-acute (3 days – 3 weeks)

Gradual loading and movement retraining begin. Your physiotherapist will prescribe exercises tailored to your injury.

### Phase 3: Rehabilitation (3 weeks – 3 months)

Strength, flexibility, and sport-specific drills prepare you for return to activity. This phase is crucial for preventing re-injury.

### Phase 4: Return to Sport

A structured progression ensures you're ready. Rushing back too soon increases the risk of setbacks.

## Why Physiotherapy Matters

Physiotherapy isn't just about treating pain—it's about restoring function, addressing movement patterns, and building resilience for the long term.
