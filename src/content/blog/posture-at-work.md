Poor posture from long hours at a desk can lead to headaches, neck pain, and back problems. Here's what you need to know.

## The Impact of Poor Posture

When you slouch or crane your neck toward the screen, you place extra stress on muscles and joints. Over time, this can cause:

- Chronic neck and shoulder pain
- Headaches
- Lower back discomfort
- Reduced lung capacity

## Simple Fixes

1. **Ergonomic setup** — Screen at eye level, keyboard at elbow height
2. **Movement breaks** — Stand and stretch every 30 minutes
3. **Posture cues** — Set a reminder to check your position
4. **Strengthening** — Build the muscles that support good posture

## When to Seek Help

If you've tried these changes and still have pain, a physiotherapist can assess your posture and create a personalized plan. Sometimes the issue isn't just "sitting wrong"—it's muscle imbalances or joint restrictions that need targeted treatment.
