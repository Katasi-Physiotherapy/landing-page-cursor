If you spend hours at a desk, you're not alone in experiencing back pain. Here are five evidence-based tips to help.

## 1. Adjust Your Chair

Your feet should rest flat on the floor, with knees at 90 degrees. Your screen should be at eye level to avoid neck strain.

## 2. Take Regular Breaks

Stand up and move every 30–45 minutes. A short walk or stretch can prevent stiffness from setting in.

## 3. Strengthen Your Core

A strong core supports your spine. Simple exercises like planks and bird-dogs can make a big difference over time.

## 4. Check Your Posture

Shoulders relaxed, ears over shoulders, chin slightly tucked. It takes practice, but good posture becomes habit.

## 5. When to See a Physiotherapist

If pain persists for more than a few weeks, or you have numbness or tingling, it's time to get a proper assessment. Physiotherapy can address the root cause, not just the symptoms.
